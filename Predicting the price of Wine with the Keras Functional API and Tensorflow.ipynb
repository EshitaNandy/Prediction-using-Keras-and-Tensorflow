      "Although it's not very aromatic, the nose on this wine is easygoing, with mild peach and apple aromas. It feels fresh and medium bodied, with apple, peach and melony flavors, the latter perhaps due to the blend's 14% white Carmenère. It shows mellow oak notes and latent acidity on the finish.\n",

      "This is the first vintage of this wine to include estate fruit, along with fruit from Klipsun, Bacchus and Red Willow. A complex medley of herb and spice aromas accented by purple flowers is followed by bold yet still refined dark-fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It has the tannin to go the distance. Best after 2020.\n",

      "This is a darkly fruity and spicy wine from a site overlooking the Marin Coastal range, often shrouded in fog. Planted to five clones, the site provides plenty of cardamom, clove, forest floor and black tea while allowing for a wildness of plum tart and crusty bread. The oak imprint is light.\n",

      "\n",
      "Concentrated boysenberry and blackberry flavors give this dry and full-bodied wine a lot to like. They melt in the mouth and seem to coat the tongue with a ripeness that's rich but not sweet. Throw in dark chocolate, black currant and a creamy in mouthfeel, and it's an outstanding wine.\n",
      "Predicted Price:  30.293474 Actual Price:  40.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Velvety and showing a bite of oak, this wine blends grapes from Spring Hill Vineyard and Nobles Vineyard, with a small addition from Horseshoe Bend, a coastal site that contributes earthy salinity. Bright red fruit is layered and succulent, with an underlying richness that contrasts against the sizzling acidity.\n",
      "Predicted Price:  44.6724 Actual Price:  35.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Dark berry, blue flower, brown spice, espresso and balsamic aromas take shape in the glass. The structured palate offers black cherry, clove, coffee and licorice alongside close-grained tannins that give the finish a youthful grip. Drink 2019–2028.\n",
      "Predicted Price:  74.442604 Actual Price:  75.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a terrific Chardonnay at a great price, offering subtle notes of toasted grain upfront, followed by bright lemon-lime fruit and crisp acidity. It's medium-bodied, so it won't overpower whatever food you serve it with and the laser beam of citrusy acidity on the finish is wrapped in a gauzy sheath of pleasant nuttiness. Drink now–2020, possibly longer.\n",
      "Predicted Price:  35.024696 Actual Price:  21.0 \n",

      "Concentrated aromas of blackberry and iodine are moderately complex. A tight layered palate with juicy acidity propels toasty yet bright flavors of black cherry and plum towards a finish with juicy acidity and natural spicy flavors. Drink through 2021.\n",
      "Predicted Price:  32.23911 Actual Price:  36.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "This full-bodied wine is saturated with ripe and concentrated blackberry and black-grape flavors. A layered and nicely viscous texture clings to the sides of the mouth and holds all that gorgeous fruit through the finish. It's almost all fruit, dark chocolate and a touch of clove, with little obvious oak, for a pure and memorable character.\n",
      "Predicted Price:  31.202011 Actual Price:  32.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Another good example of how Lake County grows excellent big reds. Delicious, rich, almost chocolaty, this nevertheless dry wine is packed with flavor. It's concentrated, very smooth despite massive tannins and just a pleasure to taste. Tempting now, but best after 2020.\n",
      "Predicted Price:  23.758106 Actual Price:  20.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Black currant stars in this mountain wine, juicy and brushy in big, pillowy tannin. Still tightly wound, it shows complexity and plenty of natural structure, begging for more time in the bottle to allow for the gunpowder, smoky oak and dark, lush black fruit to marry further. It should show best 2020 through 2023.\n",

      "Fresh apricot, melon and grapefruit abound from nose to finish in this brisk yet delectably fruity Riesling. It's dry and lithe in body yet penetrating and juicy. Zesty lime acidity lingers brightly on the finish.\n",

      "This balanced, rich wine is produced by a family company dating to the 19th century. It has tannins, signs of wood aging and layers of black fruits. Still young, it will develop well into a solid, concentrated wine. Drink from 2020.\n",

      "Dark and fruity, this juicy wine is packed with black cherry and highlighted with tobacco and coffee. The tannins are substantial, and hint at clean earth. It's big and full through the middle, but tails off a bit in the finish.\n",
      "Predicted Price:  36.48348 Actual Price:  75.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "This partnership between the Rhône's Michel Chapoutier and his American importer seems remarkably consistent. Peppery clove aromas presage a medium-bodied, silky wine that combines spice with black olives on the midpalate. It's long, finely textured and espresso-tinged on the finish.\n",
      "Predicted Price:  45.273273 Actual Price:  60.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Zesty lime and green melon notes resonate throughout this ethereally light but scintillating dry Riesling. Dusty mineral and pollen notes lend an earthen dimension to crisp, green plum and herb on the palate. It's spine tingling and revitalizing yet lingers persistently on the finish.\n",
      "Predicted Price:  33.287254 Actual Price:  54.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "A lavish oak component works well in this dark, intense wine to enhance the concentrated blackberry and black cherry flavors. Full-bodied and richly tannic in texture, the wine is very showy and delicious.\n",
      "Predicted Price:  26.239561 Actual Price:  26.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "This gentle, complex white offers lovingly crafted waves of tropical lychee and golden-apple minerality, with bites of wet stone, gravel and lemon. Balanced in acidity and a lightness of being, it's meant for the table or kitchen, to sip happily while making a meal.\n",
      "Predicted Price:  19.647402 Actual Price:  30.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "A blend of Merlot (56%) and Cabernet Franc, this wine opens with aromas of flowers, huckleberry, cardamom and green herbs, along with light barrel accents. The flavors are dense and rich but far from over the top, supported by chewy tannins and a fruit-filled finish that sails into the distance. Best after 2020.\n",

      "It's good to see this Margaret River stalwart return to the States. The 2015 DJL is a slightly nutty, toasty wine, plump and silky in texture. Pear, melon, vanilla and citrus notes finish long.\n",

      "\n",
      "The wine has powerful tannins which are balanced with equally rich fruit. It is firm, in the Saint-Estèphe style, while never losing sight of a rich fruity future. The wine, from an estate at the heart of the Pez plateau, will develop well. Drink from 2024.\n",

      "Siran is in the south of the Margaux appellation just where the gravel outcrops rise above the river. It shows its fine position in this tannic wine. It has all the black-currant fruit buried for the moment under the structure. It is a serious wine that will repay aging. Drink from 2022.\n",
      "Predicted Price:  45.5263 Actual Price:  30.0 \n",

      "Lovely from the first sniff on, this is packed with mineral-drenched fruit flavors. Pear flesh and skin dominate, along with suggestions of cucumber and white melon. The leesy minerality is a great palate cleanser.\n",

      "\n",
      "Though labeled simply Willamette Valley, the vineyard is set in the Eola Hills AVA. Complex aromas meld sassafras, Asian spices, baking spices and delicate notes of leaf and stem. The fruit is lightly brambly with an accent on raspberry flavors. The wine is well-proportioned throughout.\n",
