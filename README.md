## KERAS: The API “designed for citizenry, not for machines”.

Keras is one of the leading and official high-level neural network API of Tensorflow which is used to specify and train different programs.</br>
A well-structured code written using Python.</br>
It has the capability to support multiple back-end neural network computation engines.</br>
Belonging to the Deep Learning Library, it is capable of running either on top of Tensorflow or Theano, or CNTK. </br>
It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.</br>

- Building models using Keras is as simple as stacking layers and connecting graphs. 
- It is an open-source platform actively developed by 4800+ contributors across the world with a good amount of documentation. 
- It looks to be a best one, if not necessarily the best, API for the upcoming Tensorflow 2.0 release. 
- It has turned out to be a huge improvement over low-level deep learning APIs.

### USE CASE: Problem Statement
#### Predicting the price of Wine with the Keras Functional API and Tensorflow.

1. The overall goal is to 
#### Create a model that can identify the variety, winery and location of a wine based on a description.</br>
2. Prerequisites : 
#### Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Scikitlearn and Keras (Tensorflow).</br>

On comparing the average difference between Actual price and the Model's Predicted price, the average prediction difference is around 13Dollars in every bottle of wine 
which is really a good value to move ahead with
